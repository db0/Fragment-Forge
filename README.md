# Shader Wars v0.1

Shader Wars is a card game simulating the rise to fame of a new demo effects coder.

This a very rough release using a hardcoded deck but it should be playable with full rules enforcement.

Feel free to download and see [the single-player rules](SP_RULES.md). 

PS: The name is provisionary while I'm trying to come up with something better. Hit me with your best ideas!

## Roadmap

* Deck builder
* More cards
* Fancier card layout
* Card art
* Multiplayer rules (dependent on the card game framework adding networking code)

See the issue tracker for progress and more ideas and feel free to suggest more.
