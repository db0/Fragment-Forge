# Fragment Forge v0.18

Fragment Forge is a card game simulating the rise to fame of a new demo effects coder.

This an early release and the balance will be off. However you can make your own decks and it is playable with full rules enforcement.

Feel free to download and try [the single-player](SP_RULES.md). A tutorial is also inluded. 
You can also [play it online](http://fragmentforge.dbzer0.com/) (however the desktop client is faster)

## Roadmap

* Fancier card layout
* (More) Card art
* Multiplayer rules (dependent on the card game framework adding networking code)

See the issue tracker for progress and more ideas and feel free to suggest more.

## Done

* 100 Cards for core set card base
* Deck builder
* (Some) Card Art

## Credits

Built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and the [Card Game Framework](https://github.com/db0/godot-card-game-framework)

(Most) Shader is ported by hand to Godot from [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com). Extra thanks to [Inigo Quilez](https://www.iquilezles.org) for making ShaderToy and also releasing so many shaders in the Creative Commons. Links and credits for each Shader are inside their code.

Some influences from [Android:Netrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android:_Netrunner)
