# Fragment Forge v0.6

Fragment Forge is a card game simulating the rise to fame of a new demo effects coder.

This a very rough release using a hardcoded deck but it should be playable with full rules enforcement.

Feel free to download and see [the single-player rules](SP_RULES.md). 

PS: The name is provisionary while I'm trying to come up with something better. Hit me with your best ideas!

## Roadmap

* More cards
* Fancier card layout
* (More) Card art
* Multiplayer rules (dependent on the card game framework adding networking code)

See the issue tracker for progress and more ideas and feel free to suggest more.

## Done

* Deck builder
* (Some) Card Art

## Credits
