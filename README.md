# Fragment Forge v0.7

Fragment Forge is a card game simulating the rise to fame of a new demo effects coder.

This a very rough release containing only a few cards. However you can make your own decks and should be playable with full rules enforcement.

Feel free to download and see [the single-player rules](SP_RULES.md). 

## Roadmap

* More cards
* Fancier card layout
* (More) Card art
* Multiplayer rules (dependent on the card game framework adding networking code)

See the issue tracker for progress and more ideas and feel free to suggest more.

## Done

* Deck builder
* (Some) Card Art

## Credits

(Most) Shader is ported by hand to Godot from [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com). Extra thanks to [Inigo Quilez](https://www.iquilezles.org) for releasing so many of them in the Creative Commons. Links and credits for each Shader are inside their code.
