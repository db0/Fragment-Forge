# This class defines how the properties of the [Card] definition are to be
# used during `setup()`
#
# All the properties defined on the card json will attempt to find a matching
# label node inside the cards _card_labels dictionary.
# If one was not found, an error will be printed.
#
# The exception is properties starting with _underscore. This are considered
# Meta properties and the game will not attempt to display them on the card
# front.
