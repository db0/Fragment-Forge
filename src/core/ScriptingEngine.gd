# This class contains all the functionality required to perform
# full rules enforcement on any card.

# The automation is based on [ScriptTask]s. Each such "task" performs a very specific
# manipulation of the board state, based on using existing functions
# in the object manipulated.
# Therefore each task function provides effectively a text-based API
#
# This class is loaded by each card invidually, and contains a link
# back to the card object itself
