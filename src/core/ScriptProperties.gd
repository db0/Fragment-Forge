const KEY_ASK_INTEGER_MAX := "ask_int_max"
# This is a versatile value that can be inserted into any various keys

# in time.
# The value has to be appended with the type of seek to do to determine

#
# When this value is set, the relevant key **must** also exist in the

# Specify the subjects as well as the things to count.
#
# Inside the per_ key, you again have to specify [KEY_SUBJECT](#KEY_SUBJECT)
# lookup which is relevant for the per search.
#
# This allows us to calculate the effects of card scripts during runtime.
# For a complex example:
#```
#{"manual":
#	{"hand": [
#		{"name": "move_card_to_container",
#		"subject": "index",
#		"subject_count": "per_boardseek",

#			"filter_state_seek": [
#				{"filter_properties": {
#					"Power": 0}
#				}
#			]
#		}}
#	]}
#}
#```
# The above example can be tranlated to:
# "Draw 1 card for each card with 0 power on the board"
const VALUE_PER := "per_"
# Value Type: String
#
# This key is typically needed in combination with [KEY_PER_PROPERTY](#KEY_PER_PROPERTY)
# to specify which property to base the per upon. The property **has** to be
# a number.
const KEY_PROPERTY_NAME := "property_name"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# A [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) key for perfoming an effect equal to a number of tokens on the subject(s)
#
# Other than the subject defintions the [KEY_TOKEN_NAME](#KEY_TOKEN_NAME)
# has to also be provided
const KEY_PER_TOKEN := "per_token"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# A [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) key for perfoming an effect equal to a accumulated property on the subject(s)
#
# Other than the subject defintions the [KEY_PROPERTY_NAME](#KEY_PROPERTY_NAME)
# has to also be provided. Obviously, the property specified has to be a number.
const KEY_PER_PROPERTY := "per_property"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# A [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) key for perfoming an effect equal to a number
# of cards in pile matching a filter.
#
# Typically the [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT)
# inside this dictionary would be set to
# [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT_V_ALL](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT_V_ALL),
# but a [FILTER_STATE](#FILTER_STATE) should also be typically specified
const KEY_PER_TUTOR := "per_tutor"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# A [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) key for perfoming an effect equal the number of
# cards on the board matching a filter.
#
# Typically the [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT)
# inside this dictionary would be set to
# [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT_V_ALL](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT_V_ALL),
# but a [FILTER_STATE](#FILTER_STATE) should also be typically specified
const KEY_PER_BOARDSEEK := "per_boardseek"
# Value Type: String
# * "eq" (Defaut): Equal
# * "ne": Not equal (This can be used to againsr strings as well)
# * "gt": Greater than
# * "lt": Less than
# * "le": Less than or Equal
# * "ge": Geater than or equal
#
# Key is used typically to do numerical comparisons during filters involving
# numerical numbers.
#
# I.e. it allows to write the script for something like:
# "Destroy all Monsters with cost equal or higher than 3"
const KEY_COMPARISON := "comparison"
# This is a versatile value that can be inserted into any various keys
# when a task needs to use a previously inputed integer provided
# with a [ask_integer](ScriptingEngine#ask_integer) task.
# When detected ,the task will retrieve the stored number and use it as specified
#
# The following keys support this value
# * [KEY_MODIFICATION](#KEY_MODIFICATION)
# * [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT) (only for specific tasks, see documentation)
# * [KEY_OBJECT_COUNT](#KEY_OBJECT_COUNT) (only for specific tasks, see documentation)
const VALUE_RETRIEVE_INTEGER := "retrieve_integer"
# Value Type: bool (Default = false)
#
# Specifies whether this script or task can be skipped by the owner.
#
# This value needs to be prepended and placed
# depending on what it is making optional
#
# If it is making a sigle task optional, you need to add "task" at the end
# and place it inside a task definition
# Example:
# ```
#"manual": {
#	"board": [
#		{"name": "rotate_card",
#		"is_optional_task": true,
#		"subject": "self",
#		"degrees": 90},
#	]}
# ```
# If you want to make a whole script optional, then you need to place it on
# the same level as the state and append the state name
# Example:
# ```
#"card_flipped": {
#	"is_optional_board": true,
#	"board": [
#		{"name": "rotate_card",
#		"is_cost": true,
#		"subject": "self",
#		"degrees": 90}
#	]}
# ```
# When set to true, a confirmation window will appear to the player
# when this script/task is about to execute.
#
# At the task level, it will ask the player before activating that task only
# If that task is a cost, it will also prevent subsequent tasks from firing
#
# At the script level, the whole script if cancelled.
const KEY_IS_OPTIONAL := "is_optional_"
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filter Definition Keys
#
# The below are all the possible dictionary keys that can be set in a
# filter definition.
# Most of them are only relevant for a specific task type
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Value Type: Array
#
# Filter used for checking against the Card state
#
# This is open ended to be appended, as the check can be run either
# against the trigger card, or the subjects card.
#
# One of the following strings HAS to be appended at the end:
# * "trigger": Will only filter cards triggering this effect via signals.
# * "subject": Will only filter cards that are looked up as targets for the effect.
# * "seek": Will only filter cards that are automatically sought on the board.
# * "tutor": Will only filter cards that are automaticaly sought in a pile.
#
# see [check_validity()](#check_validity-static)
#
# The content of this value has to be an array of dictionaries
# The different elements in the array act as an "OR" check. If **any** of the
# dictionary filters matches, then the card will be considered a valid target.
#
# Each filter  dictionary has to contain at least one of the various FILTER_ Keys
# All the FILTER_ keys act as an "AND" check. The Dictionary filter will only
# match, if **all** the filters requested match the card's state.
#
# This allows a very high level of flexibility in filtering exactly the cards
# required.
#
# Here's a particularly complex script example that can be achieved:
#```
#"manual": {
#	"hand": [
#		{"name": "rotate_card",
#		"subject": "boardseek",
#		"subject_count": "all",
#		"filter_state_seek": [
#			{"filter_tokens": [
#				{"filter_token_name": "void",
#				"filter_token_count": 1,
#				"comparison": "gt"},
#				{"filter_token_name": "blood"}
#			],
#			"filter_properties": {"Type": "Barbarian"}},
#			{"filter_properties": {"Type": "Soldier"}}
#		],
#		"degrees": 90}
#	]
#}
#```
# This example would roughly translate to the following ability:
# *"Rotate to 90 degrees all barbarians with more than 1 void tokens and
# at least 1 blood token, as well as all soldiers."*
const FILTER_STATE := "filter_state_"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# Filter used for checking against the Card properties
#
# Each value is a dictionary where the  key is a card property, and the value
# is the desired property value to match on the filtered card.
const FILTER_PROPERTIES := "filter_properties"
# Value Type: int.
#
# Filter used in for checking against [TRIGGER_DEGREES](#KEY_MODIFICATION)
const FILTER_DEGREES := "filter_degrees"

# Value Type: String
# * [TRIGGER_V_TOKENS_INCREASED](#TRIGGER_V_TOKENS_INCREASED)
# * [TRIGGER_V_TOKENS_DECREASED](#TRIGGER_V_TOKENS_DECREASED)
const FILTER_TOKEN_DIFFERENCE := "filter_token_difference"
# Value Type: String.
#
# Filter used for checking against [TRIGGER_TOKEN_NAME](#TRIGGER_TOKEN_NAME)
# and in [check_state](#check_state)
const FILTER_TOKEN_NAME := "filter_token_name"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# Filter used for checking in [check_state](#check_state)
# It contains a list of dictionaries, each detailing a token state that
# is wished on this subject. If any of them fails to match, then the whole
# filter fails to match.
#
# This allows us to check for multiple tokens at once. For example:
# "If target has a blood and a void token..."
#
# The below sample script, will rotate all cards which have
# any number of void tokens and exactly 1 bio token, 90 degrees
#```
#"manual": {
#	"hand": [
#		{"name": "rotate_card",
#		"subject": "boardseek",
#		"subject_count": "all",
#		"filter_state_seek": {

#			]
#		},
#		"degrees": 90}
#	]
#}
#```
const FILTER_TOKENS := "filter_tokens"
# Value Type: Dictionary.
#
# Filter key used for checking against card_properties_modified details.
#
# Checking for modified properties is a bit trickier than other filters
# A signal emited from modified properties, will include as values the
# property name changed, and its new and old values.
#
# The filter specified in the card script definition, will have
# as the requested property filter, a dictionary inside the card_scripts
# with the key [FILTER_MODIFIED_PROPERTIES](#FILTER_MODIFIED_PROPERTIES).
#
# Inside that dictionary will be another dictionary with one key per
# property. That key inside will (optionally) have yet another dictionary
# within, with specific values to filter. A sample filter script for triggering
# only if a specific property was modified would look like this:
# ```
#{"card_properties_modified": {
#	"hand": [{
#		"name": "flip_card",
#		"subject": "self",
#		"set_faceup": false
#	}],
#	"filter_modified_properties":
#		{
#			"Type": {}
#		},
#	"trigger": "another"}
#}
# ```
# The above example will trigger only if the "Type" property of another card
# is modified. But it does not care to what value the Type property changed.
#
# A more advanced trigger might look like this:
# ```
#{"card_properties_modified": {
#	"hand": [{
#		"name": "flip_card",
#		"subject": "self",
#		"set_faceup": false
#		}],
#	"filter_modified_properties": {
#		"Type": {
#			"new_value": "Orange",
#			"previous_value": "Green"
#		}
#	},
#	"trigger": "another"}
#}
# ```
# The above example will only trigger on the "Type" property changing on
# another card, and only if it changed from "Green" to "Orange"
const FILTER_MODIFIED_PROPERTIES := "filter_modified_properties"
# Value Type: String.
#
# Filter used for checking against [TRIGGER_NEW_PROPERTY_VALUE](#TRIGGER_NEW_PROPERTY_VALUE)
